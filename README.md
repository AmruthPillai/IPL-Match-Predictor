# IPL Match Predictor

This notebook is mainly an experimentation playground for myself to learn data science and statistics.

I'll be attempting to predict the winner of an IPL match, given two teams (and maybe other parameters as well), using plain math. No machine learning, deep neural nets to be seen here.

Check out the <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> (`ipl-match-stats.ipynb`) for a detailed explanation on how it all works!
