# IPL Match Predictor

This notebook is mainly an experimentation playground for myself to learn data science and statistics.

I'll be attempting to predict the winner of an IPL match, given two teams (and maybe other parameters as well), using K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.

We're using KNN because technically, I will need a result out of the given set of discrete values. It is more of a classification problem than a regression problem, where I would be prediction values arbitrarily.

Check out the <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> (`IPL Match Predictor.ipynb`) for a detailed explanation on how it all works!
